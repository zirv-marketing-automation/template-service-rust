# Template Service Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the refactoring of the template service into a multi-service architecture.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Common Library (`common/`)
- **Purpose**: Shared functionality across all services
- **Contents**:
  - Logging configuration (`config/logging.rs`)
  - Logging initialization utilities (`logging.rs`)
  - Environment variable helpers (`utils/mod.rs`)
- **Benefits**: Consistency across services, single source of truth for shared logic

### 2. Created Services Directory Structure (`services/`)

#### API Service (`services/api/`)
- Moved from `backend/` directory
- REST API built with Actix Web
- Uses the `common` library for logging
- Has its own Dockerfile for containerization
- Binary name: `api`

#### Kafka Consumer Service (`services/kafka/`)
- New service for consuming Kafka messages
- Uses `zirv-kafka` package (ready to uncomment when librdkafka is available)
- Integrates with `kafka-messages` library for message handling
- Has its own Dockerfile for containerization
- Binary name: `kafka`

### 3. Created Kafka Messages Library (`kafka-messages/`)
- **Purpose**: Define message structures and handlers
- **Key Components**:
  - `MessageHandler` trait - all handlers must implement this
  - Example `TemplateMessageHandler` showing the pattern
  - Messages are coupled with their topics
- **How to Add New Handlers**: See ARCHITECTURE.md

### 4. Docker & Orchestration

#### Individual Dockerfiles
- `services/api/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for API service
- `services/kafka/Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for Kafka service
- Both use Rust 1.90 and Debian bullseye-slim runtime

#### docker-compose.yml
- Orchestrates all services:
  - API service (port 3000)
  - Kafka consumer service
  - MySQL database (port 3306)
  - Kafka (port 9092)
  - Zookeeper
- Services connected via Docker network
- Proper dependency management

### 5. CI/CD Updates

#### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Builds all three binaries: `api`, `kafka`, `backend`
- Uploads each as separate artifacts
- All linting and tests pass

#### CD Workflow (`.github/workflows/cd.yml`)
- Builds and pushes two Docker images:
  - `ghcr.io/zirv-marketing-automation/template-service-rust-api`
  - `ghcr.io/zirv-marketing-automation/template-service-rust-kafka`
- Separate jobs for each service
- Proper tagging with semver support

### 6. Documentation
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Detailed architecture documentation
- **This file**: High-level refactoring summary

## What Stays the Same

1. **Backend Directory**: Maintained for backward compatibility (marked as deprecated)
2. **Existing Tests**: All original tests preserved and passing
3. **Configuration System**: Still using zirv-config
4. **Database**: Still using SQLx with MySQL
5. **Logging**: Still using tracing with Kibana-compatible JSON output

## Migration Guide

### For New Features
- Use `services/api/` for API endpoints
- Use `services/kafka/` for Kafka consumers
- Add shared logic to `common/`
- Add message definitions to `kafka-messages/`

### Building Services
```bash
# Build all services
cargo build --release

# Build specific service
cargo build -p api --release
cargo build -p kafka --release

# Run tests
cargo test
```

### Running with Docker
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Build and start
docker-compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f api
docker-compose logs -f kafka-consumer
```

## Key Decisions

1. **Why keep backend/?** - Backward compatibility. Teams may have scripts or documentation referencing it.

2. **Why separate Dockerfiles?** - Each service can be:
   - Built independently
   - Deployed independently
   - Scaled independently
   - Updated without affecting others

3. **Why common library?** - Avoid code duplication, ensure consistency, single source of truth.

4. **Why MessageHandler trait?** - Provides a clean interface for coupling topics with handlers, makes it easy to add new message types.

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Kafka Integration**:
   - Install librdkafka in deployment environment
   - Uncomment `zirv-kafka` dependency in `services/kafka/Cargo.toml`
   - Uncomment Kafka integration code in `services/kafka/src/main.rs`

2. **Add More Handlers**:
   - Create new message structs in `kafka-messages/src/messages.rs`
   - Implement `MessageHandler` trait
   - Register in `services/kafka/src/main.rs`

3. **Consider Removing backend/**:
   - After migration period
   - Update all documentation and scripts
   - Remove from workspace

## Testing the Refactoring

All tests pass:
- API service: 5 tests
- Backend (legacy): 8 tests  
- Common library: 3 tests
- Kafka messages: 1 test

All linting passes:
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` ✓
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` ✓

All builds succeed:
- Debug build ✓
- Release build ✓
- Docker builds (ready to test)
